### Frontend Resource

The JavaScript file needs to be loaded as a frontend resource. Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```

After adding this configuration, restart Home Assistant.

6. Use the "Delete" button to remove notes entirely

### Tips

- The text area automatically resizes based on content
- Empty notes are automatically removed to keep storage clean
- All notes are stored locally on your Home Assistant instance

### File Descriptions

- **`__init__.py`** - Contains the main integration setup, storage management, and REST API endpoints for saving/loading notes
- **`manifest.json`** - Home Assistant integration manifest defining dependencies, version, and metadata
- **`const.py`** - Defines constants used throughout the integration
- **`services.yaml`** - Defines any services exposed by the integration
- **`entity-notes.js`** - Frontend component that injects the notes interface into entity dialogs
- **`hacs.json`** - HACS configuration file specifying compatibility and requirements

## API Endpoints

The integration exposes REST API endpoints for managing notes:

- `GET /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Retrieve note for an entity
- `POST /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Save note for an entity
- `DELETE /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Delete note for an entity

## Storage

Notes are stored in Home Assistant's internal storage system at `.storage/entity_notes.notes`. The storage is automatically managed and persisted across restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Notes not appearing
- Ensure the frontend resource is properly configured in `configuration.yaml`
- Check that the `entity-notes.js` file is in your `www` directory
- Restart Home Assistant after configuration changes

### Notes not saving
- Check Home Assistant logs for any error messages
- Ensure the integration is properly installed and loaded
- Verify file permissions in the Home Assistant directory

### Browser console errors
- Open browser developer tools and check for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the script is loading properly from `/local/entity-notes.js`
