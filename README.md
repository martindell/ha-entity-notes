The Entity Notes integration adds a notes section to every entity's "more info" dialog, allowing you to quickly add, edit, or delete notes associated with that entity.

## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS → Integrations**
2. Search for **Entity Notes**
3. Install the integration
4. **Restart Home Assistant**

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/martindell/ha-entity-notes/releases)
2. Extract the contents
3. Copy the `custom_components/entity_notes` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Integration Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **"Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Entity Notes"**
4. Click to add the integration
5. Configure your preferences:
   - **Enable debug logging**: Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - **Hide buttons when no note exists**: Hide Save/Delete buttons when no note exists
   - **Enable automatic backups**: Notes are automatically included in Home Assistant backups
   - **Maximum note length**: Set character limit (50-2000 characters)

When you change any of these options, please reload the integration.  HA only registes these settings on integration load / reload.  You'll likely also need to clear browser cache to see the changes take effect too.  So much caching!

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default | Range |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Debug Logging | Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting | `false` | true/false |
| Hide Buttons When Empty | Hide Save/Delete buttons when no note exists | `false` | true/false |
| Enable automatic backups | Include notes in HA backups | `true` | true/false |
| Maximum Note Length | Character limit for notes | `200` | 50-2000 |

#### Enable Debug Logging

**Purpose**: Provides detailed logging information for troubleshooting and development purposes.

**When to enable:**
- 🐛 **Troubleshooting issues**: When notes aren't appearing, saving, or loading correctly
- 🔍 **Development work**: When contributing to the project or customizing functionality  
- 📊 **Performance analysis**: To understand how the integration processes entity data
- 🚨 **Error investigation**: When experiencing unexpected behavior

**What it logs:**
- Entity ID detection and processing
- Note loading and saving operations
- Configuration changes and cache updates
- Frontend JavaScript initialization and errors
- API endpoint requests and responses
- Integration startup and shutdown events

**Log location**: Check **Settings → System → Logs** or your Home Assistant log files

**Example log entries:**
```
[custom_components.entity_notes] Entity Notes: Found entity ID: light.living_room
[custom_components.entity_notes] Note loaded successfully for sensor.temperature
[custom_components.entity_notes] Configuration updated: hide_buttons_when_empty=true
```

**⚠️ Important**: Disable debug logging in production environments as it can generate significant log volume.

#### Hide Buttons When No Note Exists

**Purpose**: Provides a cleaner, less cluttered user interface by hiding the Save and Delete buttons when an entity has no existing note.

**Visual behavior:**
- **When enabled (`true`)**:
  - 👁️ Buttons are **hidden** when the text area is empty AND no existing note exists
  - 👁️ Buttons **appear** as soon as you start typing or if a note already exists
  - 🎨 Creates a minimalist interface focused on entities that actually have notes
  
- **When disabled (`false`)**:
  - 👁️ Buttons are **always visible** regardless of note content
  - 🎨 Provides consistent interface across all entities

**Use cases:**

**Enable this feature if you:**
- 🎯 Want a cleaner, less cluttered interface
- 📱 Use mobile devices where screen space is limited
- 🔍 Prefer to focus attention on entities that actually have notes
- ✨ Like minimalist UI design

**Keep disabled if you:**
- 🎯 Want consistent button placement across all entities
- 🖱️ Prefer always-visible controls for quick access
- 👥 Have multiple users who might be confused by disappearing buttons
- 🔄 Frequently add/remove notes and want persistent controls

**Technical details:**
- Changes take effect immediately without restart
- Uses intelligent detection to show buttons when typing begins
- Remembers existing note state to show buttons appropriately
- Fully configurable per Home Assistant instance

**Example scenarios:**

```yaml
# Scenario 1: Clean interface preferred
hide_buttons_when_empty: true
# Result: Only entities with notes show buttons initially

# Scenario 2: Consistent interface preferred  
hide_buttons_when_empty: false
# Result: All entities always show Save/Delete buttons
```

## Usage

1. Click on any entity to open its "more info" dialog
2. Scroll down to find the **"📝 Notes"** section
3. Click in the text area to add or edit notes
4. Use the **"SAVE"** button to save your changes
5. Use the **"DELETE"** button to remove notes entirely

### Markdown Formatting

Notes support Markdown formatting. Here's everything that's supported:

```
# Title
## Subtitle
- Bullet item
- Another item
1. Numbered item
2. Another numbered item
**bold text**
*italic text*
---
https://example.com
```

Which renders as headings, lists, bold, italic, a horizontal divider, and a clickable link.

### Formatting Toolbar

To make formatting notes even easier, the editor includes a convenient toolbar above the text area when in edit mode. It provides one-click access to the most common formatting options:

*   **Undo/Redo (`↶` / `↷`)**: Reverts or restores the last action. Also accessible via standard keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`).
*   **Headings (`H1` / `H2`)**: Applies a heading style to the current line(s).
*   **Bold (`B`)**: Makes the selected text bold (`**text**`).
*   **Italic (`K`)**: Makes the selected text italic (`*text*`).
*   **Lists (`•` / `1.`)**: Formats the selected line(s) as a bulleted or numbered list. This feature intelligently handles multiple selected lines, creating correctly incremented numbered lists.
*   **Horizontal Rule (`—`)**: Inserts a horizontal rule (`---`) into the note.

### Tips

- The text area automatically resizes based on content
- Empty notes are automatically removed to keep storage clean
- Character count is displayed to help you stay within limits
- Configuration changes take effect immediately without restart

## Data Storage & Backup

Entity Notes provides comprehensive data protection through multiple backup mechanisms:

### Automatic Backup (Recommended)

**Your notes are automatically protected** through Home Assistant's built-in backup system:

- **Automatic inclusion**: Notes are stored in `.storage/entity_notes.notes` and automatically included in all Home Assistant backups
- **System-wide protection**: When you create a Home Assistant backup (manual or scheduled), your notes are included
- **Restore compatibility**: Notes are automatically restored when you restore a Home Assistant backup
- **No additional setup required**: This protection works out of the box

### Manual Backup Services

The integration also provides dedicated backup services for additional flexibility:

#### Available Services

| Service | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `entity_notes.backup_notes` | Create a manual backup of all notes | Call manually or via automation |
| `entity_notes.restore_notes` | Restore notes from manual backup | Call manually or via automation |

#### Manual Backup Details

- **Backup location**: `<config_directory>/entity_notes_backup.json`
- **Format**: Human-readable JSON file
- **Content**: All entity notes with their associated entity IDs
- **Use cases**: 
  - Before major system changes
  - Creating specific notes-only backups
  - Migrating notes between systems
  - Automated backup schedules

#### Example Automation for Scheduled Backups

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Backup Entity Notes Weekly"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "02:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - sun
    action:
      - service: entity_notes.backup_notes
```

#### Manual Service Calls

**Create a backup:**
```yaml
service: entity_notes.backup_notes
```

**Restore from backup:**
```yaml
service: entity_notes.restore_notes
```

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Rely on Home Assistant backups**: Your notes are automatically protected through regular HA backups
2. **Use manual services for specific needs**: Create targeted backups before major changes
3. **Schedule regular backups**: Set up automations for additional protection
4. **Test restore procedures**: Verify your backup strategy works as expected

## API Endpoints

The integration exposes REST API endpoints for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Retrieve note for an entity
- `POST /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Save note for an entity (JSON: `{"note": "text"}`)
- `DELETE /api/entity_notes/{entity_id}` - Delete note for an entity
